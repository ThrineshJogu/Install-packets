                    and recreate the container.

                    if not will wait for 30 secs and recreate the container.

3. startup probe : when the new pod is created it will take at least 10 to 30 secs of time until the pod is created startup
                    probe will restrict the readiness and liveness probes to check for health for every 5 secs.
