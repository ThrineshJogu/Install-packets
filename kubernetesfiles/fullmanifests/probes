probes: it will check the health status of the containers inside pod

1. Readiness probe: It will check whether container is running or not for every 5secs if not will wait for 30 secs 
                    and recreate the container.

2. Liveness probe:  It will check whether container is responding to user request or not for every 5 secs 
                    if not will wait for 30 secs and recreate the container.

3. startup probe : when the new pod is created it will take at least 10 to 30 secs of time until the pod is created startup
                    probe will restrict the readiness and liveness probes to check for health for every 5 secs.
                    Note: This is not used mostly.
